# 🧠 AYUSH-ICD11 Mapper

FHIR-compliant ICD-11 terminology mapping system for AYUSH healthcare, developed during my internship at IIT Guwahati.

---

## 🚀 Overview

AYUSH-ICD11 Mapper is a healthcare interoperability system that maps traditional AYUSH morbidity data (Ayurveda, Siddha, Unani) to standardized ICD-11 codes using FHIR-compliant architecture.

This enables:

- Structured clinical data exchange
- Healthcare interoperability
- Standardized diagnosis representation
- Integration with modern health information systems
